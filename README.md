With Spotify, we have easy acces to tons of music from past 100 year which we can enjoy,share and discuss with our friends and family. But There is a question, 
How has music changed over the past 100 years?

In this project, we will try to answer some of these questions. Our major focus is on the following issues:

- How has music release and artist count evolve in the past century? 
    - Release trend
    - Artists trend
- Evolution of major musical characteristics in the past century
    - Identifying the trend in audio features over time
    - Identifying the trend in popularity of tracks over time
- Correlation of audio features with one another?
    - Identifying how popularity could be related to key features

Methodology
To answer the above questions, we will focus on the Spotify dataset over 175000 songs from Kaggle with various audio features, artists, album, date released, popularity, etc.
for various songs. 
Here, We will employ a combination ananlyis techeniques like descriptive analysis , exploratry analyis , data munging/manipulation ,correlation, comparison, 
summary statistics and time series analysis etc. to answer the above questions.

Implications
After performing the exploratory data analysis and identifying trends in the dataset we can predict whether music in intrest will be popular or not in the future 
and what musical trend we can expect in 2020 to 2030.
